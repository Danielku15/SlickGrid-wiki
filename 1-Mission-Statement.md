As stated on his repo, and the home page here, MLeibman is too busy to maintain SlickGrid at present.

Like all active users of SlickGrid, I have my own customisations which are probably not suitable for the average user. 

What is needed at the moment is a dedicated 'alternative master' where the main build is kept up to date and has core enhancements applied, but that does not turn into a personalised build.
It's a very popular and widely forked project, so there are still a lot of Issues and Pull Requests coming in. However the quality of these varies wildly. Moderation is necessary.

So to this end, I have forked [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid)

The goals:
- apply carefully screened bugfixes and enhancements to a fork of the base mleibman/SlickGrid master repo 
- keep the base SlickGrid build up date to reflect the latest dependencies
- position this repo as an 'alternative master'
- maintain a patch list of the commits to allow forked SlickGrid repos to apply the changes piecemeal where possible
