As stated on his repo, and the home page here, MLeibman is too busy to maintain SlickGrid at present.

This aims to be a viable alternative master repo while MLeibman is busy. It builds on the current state of the mleibman/SlickGrid master branch, keeping libraries up to date and applying small, safe patches and enhancements.

These patches will head off some of the problems experienced by new adopters in the last year or so.


It's a very popular and widely forked project, so there are still a lot of Issues and Pull Requests coming in. However the quality of these varies wildly.

In this page I'm trying to collect a series of carefully screened patches that can be applied to the base mleibman/SlickGrid master repo to do small, atomic bugfixes and enhancements. I and many others have created major forks of SlickGrid that will never be able to be merged back into the codebase. For us it is an advantage to have these small patches to keep us up to date. Hopefully for new users, the new repo will fix many of the small problems that are being flagged.

To this end, I'm providing each GIT patch for download, plus maintaining the 6pac/SlickGrid master repo as a fork of mleibman/SlickGrid master with all the patches applied. Thus 6pac/SlickGrid should be an up-to-date, ready-to-download version of the latest SlickGrid master. Or, you can apply the individual patches to your own repo. Your choice.
