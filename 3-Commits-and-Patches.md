# Commit and patch list

To this end, I'm providing each GIT patch for download, plus maintaining the [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid) master repo 
as a fork of mleibman/SlickGrid master with all the patches applied. Thus 6pac/SlickGrid should be an up-to-date, ready-to-download version 
of the latest SlickGrid master. Or, you can apply the individual patches to your own repo. Your choice.

The master repo: [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid)
