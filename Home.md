# SlickGrid Alternative Master Repo

SlickGrid 2.2.4 Out Now! [download the latest SlickGrid release](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/releases)

Props to MLeibman's for the fantastic SlickGrid project! We all get busy from time to time, and since the post

> UPDATE: March 5th, 2014 - I have too many things going on in my life right now to really give SlickGrid support and development the time and attention it deserves. I am not stopping it, but I will most likely be unresponsive for some time. Sorry.*

things have been pretty quiet on the admin side of things at the mleibman/SlickGrid repo.

This aims to be a viable alternative master repo while MLeibman is busy. It builds on the current state of the mleibman/SlickGrid master branch, keeping libraries up to date and applying small, safe core patches and enhancements _without_ turning into a personalised build. 

These patches will head off some of the problems experienced by new adopters in the last year or so.
