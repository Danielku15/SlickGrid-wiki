# SlickGrid Community Activity

Before putting this repo together I trawled around a bit looking for activity on all the forked repos out there.
I was surprised at the amount of activity - there were a number of people and groups of people who had done major work, often synchronising between each other's forks.

Some examples are: 

[SimpleGy](https://github.com/SimplGy/SlickGrid/commits/master) who has been working on a 'pinned columns' implementation

[GerHobbelt](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SlickGrid/commits/gh-pages) who is a whopping 1000 or so commits ahead of the fork point. (link points at the bleeding edge there)

I think a lot of SlickGrid users would be interested in the bigger picture behind major active forks, so if you'd like to give an overview of what your fork does, and any goals you might have, please get in touch and I'll post it here.
