# SlickGrid Community Activity

Before putting this repo together I trawled around a bit looking for activity on all the forked repos out there.
I was surprised at the amount of activity - there were a number of people and groups of people who had done major work, often synchronising between each other's forks.

Some examples are: 

- [SimpleGy](https://github.com/SimplGy/SlickGrid/commits/master) who has been working on a 'pinned columns' implementation

  Other and related frozen row/column work has been done by

  + [@JLync7](https://github.com/JLynch7/SlickGrid), in particular his [2.0-frozenRowsAndColumns branch](https://github.com/JLynch7/SlickGrid/tree/2.0-frozenRowsAndColumns), which has been picked up by many people including [Revionics](https://github.com/Revionics/SlickGrid)

  + apparently independent work by [ddomingues](https://github.com/ddomingues/X-SlickGrid) called X-SlickGrid, which was started in 2015 

- [GerHobbelt](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SlickGrid) who is a whopping 1000 or so commits ahead of the fork point. (link points at the bleeding edge there; this fork does not yet offer frozen rows and columns but does include row and column spanning (similar Excel's 'merge cells' feature), thanks to work by [k0stya](https://github.com/k0stya/SlickGrid), [ojotoxy](https://github.com/ojotoxy/SlickGrid), [Celebio]((https://github.com/Celebio/SlickGrid)) and others.

I think a lot of SlickGrid users would be interested in the bigger picture behind major active forks, so if you'd like to give an overview of what your fork does, and any goals you might have, please get in touch and I'll post it here.
