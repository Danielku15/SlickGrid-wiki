Although the source of the [first example](http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example1-simple.html) is self-explanatory, it's worth to point out the basics of SlickGrid. The following line:

`var slickgrid = new Slick.Grid("#node", rows, columns, options);`

initializes -but doesn't display- SlickGrid, assigns it's interface to the `slickgrid` var. Now we can use `slickgrid.someMethod()` in order to interact with it.

**Node**

`"#node"` points to the HTML element where the grid should appear, typically being an empty `<div>`.

**Rows**

`rows` is an array of data objects. Example:

    var rows = [
        {
            field_1: "value1",
            field_2: "value2"
        }, {
            field_1: "value3",
            field_2: "value4"
        }
    ];

Providing data to the grid is explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Providing-data-to-the-grid)

As it is passed by reference to the `Slick.Grid()` method, you can add and remove data objects to it without having to pass them again, by just refreshing SlickGrid's data model and view:

    slickgrid.updateRowCount();
    slickgrid.render();

The only exception to this is when deleting or replacing all data objects from `rows`:

    slickgrid.setData(rows); // A different, empty or sorted array.
    slickgrid.updateRowCount();
    slickgrid.render();

DataView prevents having to modify the data for sorting and filtering purposes.

**Columns**

`columns` is an array of objects, having at least the following fields:

* _name_ - The name to be displayed in the view.
* _field_ - The field name used in the data row objects.
* _id_ - An unique identifier for each column in the model, allowing to set more than one column reading the same field.

Other fields include:

        resizable
        sortable
        minWidth
        rerenderOnResize
        headerCssClass

Example:

    var columns = [
        {
            name: "Address",
            field: "address"
            id: "address", // In most cases field and id will have the same value.
            sortable: true
        }, 
        {
            name: "Rating, in %",
            field: "rating" // This and the following column read the same data, but can present it in a different way.
            id: "rating_percent",
            resizable: false
        }, 
        {
            name: "Rating, in stars",
            field: "rating"
            id: "rating_stars"
        }
    ];

**Options**

`enableCellNavigation: true` allows keyboard navigation. The `.active` CSS property defines the appearance of the currently selected cell.

[These](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Grid-Options) are all the currently available options.

**Events**

An example:

    slickgrid.onDblClick.subscribe(function(e, args){
        var cell = slickgrid.getCellFromEvent(e);
        var row = cell.row;
        var column = slickgrid.getColumns()[cell.cell]; // object containing name, field, id, etc
    });

To date, [these](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Grid-Events) following events are available. They can be figured out by browsing the `handleDblClick`, `handleKeyDown`, etc, source, included in slick.grid.js.

**Basic sorting**

It can be achieved by listening the `onSort` method:

		slickgrid.onSort.subscribe(function(e, args){ // args: sort information. 
			
			var field = args.sortCol.field;
			
			rows.sort(function(a, b){
				var result = 
					a[field] > b[field] ? 1 :
					a[field] < b[field] ? -1 :
					0
				; 
					
				return args.sortAsc ? result : -result;
				
			});
			
			slickgrid.setData(rows);
			slickgrid.updateRowCount();
			slickgrid.render();			
		});


**DataView**

It allows to sort and filter the data without modifying it.
